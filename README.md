# Version control with Git

This repository is related to the course Version Control with Git (JEM 234).

The folder "folder" is not related to the joined project written by Jan Hrušák and Jakub Michalski. The folder called "project" contains everything related to the project. It contains "project_main.md" which is a markdown that is basically our project. Other files are just related to this markdown.
